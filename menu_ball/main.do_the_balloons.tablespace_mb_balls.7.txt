This lists free space within a tablespace, along with any objects that have NEXT extents larger than the largest free
block in that tablespace.  Objects that cannot generate another extent are marked as needing immediate attention
(Panic), and objects that cannot generate two more extents are flagged with a warning (Warn).  Flags such as (x2)
tell you that two objects require attention.
