Set this flag to use the total number of bytes the
segment is currently using (instead of the table's
original INITIAL_EXTENT value), as the value to
use for the INITIAL_EXTENT in the copyable SQL, so
that the table would be recreated in a single extent.
(The NEXT_EXTENT is limited to no more than the
INITIAL_EXTENT value)
